# My Digital Garden

Welcome to my digital garden! This repository houses the files that power my online garden, built using [oleeskild's Obsidian Digital Garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden).  I've drawn inspiration from several other gardens, and I'm happy to share the details.

## Inspiration & Credits

My garden wouldn't be what it is without the influence of these fantastic resources:

*   **Sidebar:** The bottom-right sidebar design is inspired by [The Threshold](https://hermitage.utsob.me/).
*   **Comments:** I use [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for comments, a feature I discovered through [graysonarts's digital garden](https://github.com/graysonarts/digital-garden/tree/main).
*   **Theme:** The visual foundation is [Ultra Lobster](https://github.com/7368697661/Ultra-Lobster), which I've customized further using the [Style Settings plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).

## Customization

My website has a distinct visual style.  If you'd like to customize your own garden similarly, the best approach is to use your browser's developer tools.  Pressing F12 (or right-clicking an element and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element") will allow you to see the underlying HTML and CSS, making it easy to identify which files control which elements.

## Questions?

I'm always open to questions! Feel free to reach out if you have any.
