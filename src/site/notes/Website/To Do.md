> [!INFO] To do  
> This is my To Do list concerning this website. Know how any of these problems can be solved? I would greatly appreciate any help :)

What remains to be done:
- [[Notes/Signals and Systems\|Signals and Systems]] continue from chapter 5. Elaborate on Parseval's Theorem.
- [[Notes/Solid-State Theory\|Solid-State Theory]] needs manual adjustment and adding images.
- [[Notes/Intersubband Optoelectronics\|Intersubband Optoelectronics]] needs manual adjustment and images. Plenty of work ahead compared to SST.
- [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics Notes\|Ultrafast Laser Physics Notes]] (my favourite course!) needs some work, mainly images.
- 'About me' and 'About' page, since every professional page needs that, I think
- Add footer with contact information, plus light/dark button.
