# June, 2025
## 17th of June
Sony $\alpha6400$ with 16 - 50 mm (f/3.5 - f/5.6) objective. 

These are the first images taken with my first proper camera, so still lots of practice ahead of me. I still have to figure out how to avoid the unwanted vignette, and that the auto focus (yes I know) is used correctly.

## 21st of June
Sony $\alpha6400$ with 16 - 50 mm objective. 

Some more experimenting after actually reading the manual and watching a 40 minute video just on the settings. These images are taken with the aperture mode, where I tried to adjust the aperture and ISO. I used the vivid creative style.
