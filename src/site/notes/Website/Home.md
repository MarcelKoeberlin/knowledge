Hi there!

Welcome to my personal website—a space where I share everything I consider worth publishing. This site serves as a "knowledge vault", also known as a "digital garden." This is the perfect place to start reading up on some topics:

| **Notes**                                                                                                                           | **Progress** |

| **[[Notes/Quantum Optics/Quantum Optics\|Quantum Optics]]**                                                                         | Chapter 2    |

Here's a little peek at what's currently obsolete or planned for the future:

- **Intersubband Optoelectronics:** The notes for this are quite rough, such that I decided to hide them.
- **Quantum Information Theory:** Most of the content is there, but it really needs better formatting. It's a significant task for a course that's not my main focus anymore!
- **Microelectronic Circuits:** I’m hoping to dive into this one when I find some spare time.

I’ve always preferred making my own notes for studying, even when the official lecture notes were well-written. I held my notes to a high standard – initially, just enough for me to pass the exam. Over time, that standard grew, and eventually, some of my friends started using them too. When I arrived at ETH, I was pleased to find the [VMP](https://exams.vmp.ethz.ch/) website, which hosts old exam protocols and lecture notes. I decided to upload my own notes there, hoping they might be useful to someone.

So, I began converting my handwritten notes to Markdown, the format this website uses. It's a fair bit of work, and as my standards for quality kept rising, I decided to start creating some notes completely from scratch. It might sound a bit strange, but I quickly discovered that while the physics itself is fascinating, I genuinely enjoy the act of writing good, clear notes. It started with my "Ultrafast Laser Physics" notes, and the content just grew from there. 

I genuinely hope this website and its content are useful to you. If so, I'd be delighted to hear any feedback on the material, questions you might have, or your thoughts on the website itself! :)
