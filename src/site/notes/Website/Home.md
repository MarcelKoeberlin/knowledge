Hi there!

Welcome to my personal website—a space where I share everything I consider worth publishing. This site serves as a "knowledge vault," also known as a "digital garden." While the term has its own definition, here’s what it means for me:

- Notes from courses I attended during my studies.
- Notes on specific topics I explored outside the curriculum (though these are rare).
- Notes related to my PhD work at the Attoline, which may not be relevant to those outside the group.

For efficient and stylus-free note-taking, I highly recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It’s genuinely a game changer. To host this website for free, I use the Digital Garden plugin, which you can find [here](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden).

You may notice the • symbol throughout the site. It’s used for internal navigation within Obsidian (so that I know where an image/chapter is from) and can be safely ignored. This website exists on two pages, deployed from two different services: [Vercel](https://koeberlin.vercel.app/) and [Netlify](https://koeberlin.netlify.app/). Both pages are identical (in principal), though not under the hood.

If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free contact me on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarcelKoeberlin) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-k%C3%B6berlin-776397244/).

Cheers,
