Hi there!

Welcome to my personal website—a space where I share everything I consider worth publishing. This site serves as a "knowledge vault," also known as a "digital garden."

This website began with the simple, though admittedly overkill, idea of having experimental step-by-step lab procedures readily available, eliminating the need for printed copies or bringing my laptop/tablet to the lab each time.  It started with a single document detailing procedures like laser system shutdown or specific measurement techniques. I never anticipated this project evolving into what it has become, let alone turning into a hobby.

I've never been a fan of studying for exams using the "official" lecture notes, even if they were well-written. I held my own notes to a high standard, initially ensuring they were sufficient for me to pass the exam.  Over time, this standard rose, and even some of my friends began using them.  Upon arriving at ETH, I was pleased to discover the [VMP](https://exams.vmp.ethz.ch/) website, hosting old exam protocols and lecture notes. I decided to upload my own notes there, hoping they might be useful to someone someday.

Having initially built this site around that single lab procedure note, I wondered if it could serve a greater purpose. What if, I thought, people visited the site and read my notes? I quickly realized that implementation was more straightforward than expected (although customization is a considerable undertaking), so I began converting my handwritten notes to Markdown (the format of source of this website). This is a significant amount of work, and as my standards continued to rise, I decided to start some notes from scratch.

Since not all the courses I've taken align with my current research in the [Attoline](https://ulp.ethz.ch/research/attoline.html) group, I faced a dilemma. I couldn't work on those notes and simultaneously claim to be working on my PhD (excluding the [[Notes/Plasmonics/Plasmonics\|Plasmonics]] and [[Notes/Attosecond Physics/Attosecond Physics\|Attosecond Physics]] notes).  Therefore, I decided to dedicate only my free time to them.  It might sound strange, but I soon discovered that, while the physics is interesting, simply the act of writing good notes is enjoyable. Starting with my "Ultrafast Laser Physics" notes, the content grew, and eventually, reading entire books solely to create excellent notes became normal.

**For those who skipped ahead, I hope this website and its content are useful to you!** If so, I'd be delighted to receive feedback on the content, questions, or the website itself! :)
