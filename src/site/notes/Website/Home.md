Hi there!

Welcome to my personal websiteâ€”a space where I share everything I consider worth publishing. This site serves as a "knowledge vault," also known as a "digital garden." While the term has its own definition, hereâ€™s what it means for me:

- Notes from courses I attended during my studies.
- Notes on specific topics I explored outside the curriculum (though these are rare).
- Notes related to my PhD work at the Attoline, which may not be relevant to those outside the group.

For efficient and stylus-free note-taking, I highly recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Itâ€™s genuinely a game changer. To host this website for free, I use the Digital Garden plugin, which you can find [here](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden).

You may notice the ðŸ”— symbol throughout the site. Itâ€™s used for internal navigation within Obsidian and can be safely ignored.

If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me at marcel.koeberlin(at)posteo.ch.

Cheers,  
Marcel
