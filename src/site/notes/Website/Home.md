Hi folks!

This is my private website, containing everything that I have decided is worth publishing. It is meant as a 'knowledge vault', also called a 'digital garden'. Of course, there is a definition for that word, but for me specifically, that means:
- Notes on courses that I took during my studies 
- Notes on specific topics that I took outside the curriculum (those are rare)
- Notes for my PhD in the attoline, e.g. not interesting for people outside the group.

For note-taking without a stylus, I highly recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Seriously, it's a game changer. To publish the website for free, I use the digital garden plugin found [here](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). 

You will often see the symbol ðŸ”—, you can ignore that, its only for internal use within obsidian.

_Any comments or suggestions? Write me an email to marcel.koeberlin(at)posteo.ch._
