These notes follow along the lecture 'Quantum Electronics' taught by Prof. Gallmann in 2025, as well as the book [Fundamentals of Photonics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/0471213748). This course is covered because I have to teach it. It can be seen as the introduction to [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics/Ultrafast Laser Physics\|Ultrafast Laser Physics]].

Light is fundamental to life. It enables vision, drives photosynthesis, and governs countless natural processes. In this course, we will approach light not as a stream of particles but as a wave, a perspective that allows us to understand its behaviour in materials, its interaction with matter, and its technological applications.

Light originates from accelerating charges, primarily electrons, and manifests across a vast spectrum. As it propagates through different media, its optical properties—such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference—emerge from its wave nature. These properties form the foundation of optics, which can be structured hierarchically: ray optics as an approximation of wave optics, which in turn is a subset of electromagnetic optics, all of which ultimately stem from quantum optics.

Quantum electronics focuses on the generation, manipulation, and application of coherent electromagnetic waves through quantum mechanical principles. The most notable example is the laser, a device that harnesses stimulated emission to produce highly directional, monochromatic, and coherent light. This course will explore the quantum mechanical basis of such devices and their applications.

We will primarily work with wavelengths in the visible and infrared range, spanning approximately 400 nm to 10 μm, with corresponding frequencies from to Hz and photon energies ranging from about 0.1 eV to a few eV. These scales are crucial for understanding optical and optoelectronic devices, including semiconductor lasers, modulators, and detectors.
