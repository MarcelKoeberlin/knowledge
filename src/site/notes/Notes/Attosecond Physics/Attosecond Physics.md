These notes serve as an introduction to the exciting field of attosecond physics, primarily following [Attosecond and Strong-Field Physics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/attosecond-and-strongfield-physics/B75E906A3C0AFE97902F0500312816B3) and [Attosecond Physics: Attosecond Measurements and Control of Physical Systems](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-37623-8). While these books offer extensive theoretical and mathematical insights, they can be dense and abstract. In contrast, these notes emphasise an intuitive understanding of the underlying physics. Key formulas are included, but lengthy derivations are omitted to maintain conceptual clarity. However, mathematical details will be provided when they enhance understanding.

Attosecond science is the art of controlling and measuring phenomena occurring on the timescale of $10^{-18}$ seconds. Just as a microscope magnifies small objects to reveal their finest details, attosecond technology aims to create _movies_ of ultrafast processes, capturing their dynamics in slow motion at the shortest possible timescales.

Since the atomic unit of time is 24 attoseconds, attosecond science naturally plays a crucial role in time-resolved electron dynamics. The properties of matter, in any state, are largely determined by its electronic structure. While the 20th century focused on studying and controlling the _structure_ of matter, the 21st century is centred on understanding and manipulating its _dynamics_ at the most fundamental level.

The progress of ultrafast science is tightly linked to laser development. The ultrafast revolution began with the invention of [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics/Ultrafast Laser Physics#6 Q-switching\|Q-switching]] for nanosecond pulse generation, followed by mode-locking, which enabled the creation of the first sub-picosecond pulses. Further reductions in pulse duration required additional techniques such as [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics/Ultrafast Laser Physics#2.4 Chirped Pulse Amplification\|chirped pulse amplification]], as the concepts of _ultra-intense_ and _ultrashort_ are intrinsically connected. Understanding this field benefits from a foundational knowledge of light pulses, as covered in my Ultrafast Laser Physics notes: [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics/Ultrafast Laser Physics#1 Linear Pulse Propagation\|Linear pulse propagation]], [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics/Ultrafast Laser Physics#3 Non-linear pulse propagation\|non-linear pulse propagation]], and [[Notes/Ultrafast Laser Physics/Ultrafast Laser Physics#11 Ultrafast measurement\|ultrafast measurements]]. These notes also introduce attosecond physics in the final chapter.

Probing and controlling electrons and nuclei on the attosecond timescale became feasible with the generation of attosecond pulses using few-cycle intense lasers. The observation of second-harmonic generation in 1961 marked the beginning of rapid advancements in nonlinear optics, culminating in the first demonstration of attosecond pulse generation in 2001. It quickly became evident that the generated high-order harmonics were phase-locked. Just as mode-locked lasers enabled femtosecond pulses, these phase-locked harmonics were expected to yield attosecond pulses.

Attosecond pulses promise unprecedented access to electron dynamics at their intrinsic timescale. However, determining the key parameters that characterise such dynamics remains a nontrivial challenge.
