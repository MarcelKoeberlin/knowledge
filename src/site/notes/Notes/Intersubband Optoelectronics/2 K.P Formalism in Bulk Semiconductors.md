# 2 K.P Formalism in Bulk Semiconductors

Spin-orbit coupling is neglected for simplicity. The crystal Hamiltonian is:

$$
\left(\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(r) + \frac{\hbar}{4m_0^2 e^2} (\sigma \times \nabla V) \cdot p \right) \psi = E \psi.
$$

Using Bloch's theorem, where $\Psi_{n k}(r) = e^{i k r} u_{n k}(r)$ and $p \Psi_{n k}(r) = e^{i k r} (p + \hbar k) u_{n k}(r)$, we rewrite the equation as:

$$
\left(\frac{(p + \hbar k)^2}{2m_0} + V(r)\right) u_{n k}(r) = \left(\frac{p^2}{2m_0} + \frac{\hbar}{m_0} k \cdot p + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} + V(r)\right) u_{n k}(r) = E_{n k} u_{n k}(r).
$$

Splitting the Hamiltonian into $H = H_0 + W(k)$, we consider solutions at the $\Gamma$-point ($k = 0$), such that $H_0 u_{n 0}(r) = E_{n_0} u_{n 0}(r)$. Using second-order perturbation theory, the conduction energy becomes:

$$
E_c(k) = \underbrace{E_c(0)}_{=E_g} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{m_0^2} \sum_{v \neq c} \frac{\left|\langle u_{c0} | p | u_{v0} \rangle \right|^2}{E_c - E_v}.
$$

The first-order term drops out because $\langle u_{c0} | p | u_{c0} \rangle = 0$ by symmetry, as conduction and valence bands have opposite symmetry. Simplifying for the lowest order (considering only the valence band):

$$
E_c(k) = E_g + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{m_0^2} \frac{|p_{cv}|^2}{E_g},
$$

where $p_{cv} = \langle u_{c0} | p | u_{v0} \rangle$. Defining the Kane energy $E_p = \frac{2}{m_0} |p_{cv}|^2$, we find:

$$
E_c(k) = E_g + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} \left(1 + \frac{E_p}{E_g}\right).
$$

The effective mass is:

$$
\frac{m_0}{m^*} = 1 + \frac{E_p}{E_g}.
$$

Since $E_b \gg E_g$, we conclude $m^* < m_0$. For II-VI semiconductors, $E_p$ is almost constant due to similar orbital structures. Effective mass $m^*$ can be measured experimentally, for instance, through the cyclotron frequency:

$$
\omega_c = \frac{eB}{m^*},
$$

or via Haas-van Alphen oscillations.

## 2.1 General Kane Perturbation

For the $n^{\text{th}}$ band, expand $u_{n k}(r) = \sum_m c_m^{(n)} u_{m 0}(r)$. For simplicity, in a two-band model:

$$
u_{n k}(r) = a_c u_{c0} + a_v u_{v0},
$$

where only conduction band effects on the valence band are considered. Solving the matrix equation gives:

$$
E(k) = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \frac{E_p + E_g + 2E}{E + E_g}.
$$

The effective mass becomes energy-dependent:

$$
\frac{m^*(E)}{m^*(0)} = 1 + \frac{E}{E_g}.
$$

The energy dispersion is:

$$
E(k) = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*(0)} \left(1 - \gamma k^2\right),
$$

where $\gamma = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*(0)E_g}$ is the non-parabolicity coefficient . This model works well for small $k$. For ternary alloys $AB_{1-x}C_x$, using the virtual crystal approximation , the average potential is:

$$
V_{\text{avg}} = V_A + (1-x)V_B + xV_C.
$$

This restores translational invariance, allowing Bloch's theorem to apply.

## 2.2 Envelope Function Approximation

For a periodic potential with a slowly-varying impurity potential, we write the wavefunction as:

$$
\Psi(r) = \sum_l \Psi_l(r) = \sum_l f_l^{A,B}(r) u_{l, k_0}^{A,B}(r),
$$

where $f_l^{A,B}(r)$ are slowly-varying envelope functions . "Slowly-varying" implies:

$$
\left|\partial_z^2 f_l^{A,B}(z)\right| \ll \left|\partial_z u_{l k_0}^{A,B}(z)\right|.
$$

Assuming identical Bloch functions in materials $A$ and $B$ ($u_{n, k_0}^A = u_{n, k_0}^B$), this approximation is justified as Kane energy $E_p$ is similar in both.

## 2.3 One-Band Model: Ben-Daniel Duke

Focusing on one band, we neglect the kinetic energy and enforce Bastard's boundary conditions :

- Continuity of $\Psi$,
- Continuity of $\frac{1}{m(z)} \partial_z \Psi$.

These conditions ensure conservation of probability current. The resulting Schrödinger-like equation is:

$$
\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \partial_z \frac{1}{m(z)} \partial_z + V_c(z)\right) \chi(z) = \epsilon \chi(z).
$$

This model works well for isolated bands, like the heavy-hole band. Material effects are condensed into $m^*(\epsilon, z)$, $P_{cv}$, and band offsets.

---
## 2.4 Two-Band Model

Including one effective valence band and one conduction band, the equation becomes:

$$
\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \partial_z \frac{1}{m(E, z)} \partial_z + V_c(z)\right) f_c(z) = \epsilon f_c(z),
$$

where $m(E, z)$ accounts for non-parabolicity. Assuming $V_c(z)$ is constant over a distance $L$, solutions are plane waves with wavevector $k(E, z)$.

At higher energies, the single-band model breaks down as non-parabolicity dominates.

## 2.5 The Full Model

For nonzero in-plane momentum ($k_\parallel \neq 0$), the wavevector couples states across different bands, requiring at least a 6 × 6 matrix for valence bands. Confinement potential lifts degeneracy between light and heavy holes due to different masses, leading to distinct confinement energies. The in-plane dispersion is highly non-parabolic.

## 2.6 Temperature Dependence of the Band Gap

The conduction and valence bands shift with temperature due to:

1. Lattice dilation : Temperature-dependent changes in lattice constants.
2. Electron-lattice interaction : Affects the bandgap directly.

The bandgap decreases with temperature approximately as:

$$
E_g(T) \sim
\begin{cases}
T^2 & \text{for } T \ll \theta, \\
T & \text{for } T \gg \theta,
\end{cases}
$$

where $\theta$ is the Debye temperature.
