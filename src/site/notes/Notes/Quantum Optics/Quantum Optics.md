Quantum optics brings together two major areas of physics: the study of light and quantum mechanics. By exploring how light behaves on very small scales, it reveals phenomena that classical physics cannot explainâ€”such as single-photon interference and quantum entanglement. These notes aim to provide a clear introduction to the core ideas of quantum optics.
