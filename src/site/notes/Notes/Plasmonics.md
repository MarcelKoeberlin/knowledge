>[!DANGER] Work in progress.
>Still in the very early stages.

Plasmonics forms a major part of the field of _nanophotonics_, which explores how electromagnetic fields can be confined over dimensions on the order of or smaller than the wavelength. It is based on interaction processes between electromagnetic radiation and conduction electrons at metallic interfaces or in small metallic nanostructures, leading to an enhanced optical near field of sub-wavelength dimensions. Research in this area demonstrates how unexpected behavior can occur when discontinuities or sub-wavelength structures are imposed. This field is firmly grounded in **classical** physics.

Roughly speaking, the field of plasmonics is 100 years old, yet it remains an active area of research. Four elements underlie current research in plasmonics:
1. The ready availability of state-of-the-art fabrication methods, particularly for implementing nanostructures.
2. The wealth of high-sensitivity optical characterization techniques.
3. The rapid advancement in computing power and speed, allowing for powerful numerical modeling tools.
4. The wide range of applications, from solar cells to high-resolution microscopy, drug design, and more.

# 1 Fundamentals of Plasmonics
## 1.1 Electromagnetics of Metals
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=24&selection=2,0,2,26|ðŸ”—]]

### 1.1.1 Introduction
The interaction of metals with electromagnetic waves can be understood in a classical framework based on Maxwell's equations. This holds true even for metallic nanostructures down to sizes on the order of a few nanometers, without the need to resort to quantum mechanics. This is because the high density of free carriers results in narrow spacings of the electron energy levels compared to the thermal excitation energy $k_B T$ at room temperature. It is well known that most metals are highly reflective up to some frequency in the visible range. They are thus traditionally used as cladding layers for constructing waveguides and resonators at microwave and far-infrared frequencies.

In this low-frequency regime, the _perfect conductor approximation_ of infinite or fixed finite conductivity is valid for most purposes since only a negligible fraction of the impinging electromagnetic waves penetrates the metal. However, at higher frequencies approaching the near-IR and visible spectrum, field penetration increases significantly. At UV frequencies, metals acquire a dielectric character and allow the propagation of electromagnetic waves, albeit with varying degrees of attenuation depending on the details of the electronic band structures. Alkali metals, such as sodium, have an almost free-electron-like response and thus exhibit ultraviolet transparency. Noble metals, such as gold and silver, exhibit strong absorption in this regime due to transitions between electronic bands.

### 1.1.2 Maxwell's Equation of Macroscopic Electromagnetism
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=25&selection=58,0,59,34|ðŸ”—]]

These dispersive properties can be described by a complex dielectric function $\varepsilon(\omega)$, which forms the basis of all phenomena discussed in this text. 

As a starting point, recall Maxwell's equations of macroscopic electromagnetism:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho_{\text{ext}}
$$
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}_{\text{ext}} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}.
$$

These equations link the four macroscopic fields: 
1. The dielectric displacement $\mathbf{D}$, 
2. The electric field $\mathbf{E}$, 
3. The magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$, 
4. The magnetic induction (or magnetic flux density) $\mathbf{B}$ 

with the external charge and current densities $\rho_{\text{ext}}$ and $\mathbf{J}_{\text{ext}}$. The advantage of this phenomenological approach is that details of the fundamental interactions need not be taken into account since the rapidly varying microscopic fields are averaged over distances much larger than the underlying microstructure. 

We distinguish between external ($\rho_{\text{ext}}, \mathbf{J}_{\text{ext}}$) and internal ($\rho, \mathbf{J}$) charge and current densities, so that in total:

$$
\rho_{\text{tot}} = \rho_{\text{ext}} + \rho,
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{J}_{\text{tot}} = \mathbf{J}_{\text{ext}} + \mathbf{J}.
$$

The four macroscopic fields are further linked via the polarization $\mathbf{P}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$:
$$
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P},
$$
$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \mathbf{B} - \mathbf{M},
$$
where $\varepsilon_0$ and $\mu_0$ are the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of vacuum, respectively. Since we do not treat magnetic media, we will not consider the magnetic response represented by $\mathbf{M}$. Instead, we limit the description to polarization effects. $\mathbf{P}$ describes the electric dipole moment per unit volume inside the material, caused by the alignment of microscopic dipoles with the electric field. It is related to the internal charge density via:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{P} = -\rho.
$$

Charge conservation ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = -\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$) further requires that the internal charge and current densities are linked via:

$$
\mathbf{J} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t}.
$$

The great advantage of this approach is that the macroscopic electric field includes all polarization effects: in other words, both the external and induced fields are absorbed into it. This can be shown by inserting (1.2a) into (1.1a), leading to:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_{\text{tot}}}{\varepsilon_0}.
$$

Limiting ourselves to linear, isotropic, and nonmagnetic media, one can define the constitutive relations:
$$
\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon \mathbf{E},
$$
$$
\mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mu \mathbf{H}.
$$

Here, $\varepsilon$ is the dielectric constant or relative permittivity, and $\mu = 1$ is the relative permeability of the nonmagnetic medium. The linear relationship between $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ is often implicitly defined using the dielectric susceptibility $\chi$, which describes the linear relationship between $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{E}$ via:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi \mathbf{E} && \text{with} && \varepsilon = 1 + \chi.
\end{align}
$$

The last important constitutive linear relationship to mention is that between the internal current density $\mathbf{J}$ and the electric field $\mathbf{E}$, defined via the conductivity $\sigma$ as:

$$
\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E}.
$$

It should be noted that the linear relations for $\mathbf{D}$ and $\mathbf{J}$ are only correct for linear media that do not exhibit temporal or spatial dispersion. The fundamental relation between relative permittivity (from now on called the dielectric function) and conductivity is:

$$
\varepsilon(k, \omega) = 1 + \frac{i\sigma(k, \omega)}{\varepsilon_0 \omega},
$$

for a given wavevector $k$. If the wavelength $\lambda$ is significantly longer than all characteristic dimensions (such as the unit cell size or the mean free path of the electrons), and considering the interaction of light with metals, this equation can be simplified to the limit of a spatially local response:

$$
\varepsilon(k = 0, \omega) = \varepsilon(\omega).
$$

In general, $\varepsilon(\omega) = \varepsilon_1(\omega) + i \varepsilon_2(\omega)$ and $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$ are complex-valued functions of angular frequency $\omega$. At optical frequencies, $\varepsilon$ can be experimentally determined, for example, via reflectivity studies and the determination of the complex refractive index $\tilde{n}(\omega) = n(\omega) + i \kappa(\omega)$ of the medium, defined as:

$$
\tilde{n} = \sqrt{\varepsilon}.
$$

Explicitly, this leads to the components of the dielectric function:

$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_1 = n^2 - \kappa^2, &&
\varepsilon_2 = 2n\kappa, \\
n^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\varepsilon_1^2 + \varepsilon_2^2}, &&
\kappa = \frac{\varepsilon_2}{2n}.
\end{align}
$$

$\kappa$ is called the extinction coefficient and determines the optical absorption of electromagnetic waves propagating through the medium. It is linked to the absorption coefficient $\alpha$ of Beerâ€™s law (describing the exponential attenuation of the intensity of a beam propagating through the medium via $I(x) = I_0 e^{-\alpha x}$) by the relation:

$$
\alpha(\omega) = \frac{2\kappa(\omega)\omega}{c}.
$$

Therefore, the imaginary part $\varepsilon_2$ of the dielectric function determines the amount of absorption inside the medium. For $|\varepsilon_1| \gg |\varepsilon_2|$, the real part $n$ of the refractive index, which quantifies the lowering of the phase velocity of the propagating waves due to the polarisation of the material, is mainly determined by $\varepsilon_1$. The real part of $\sigma$ determines the amount of absorption, while the imaginary part contributes to $\varepsilon_1$ and therefore to the amount of polarisation.

### 1.1.3 Travelling-Wave Solution 
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=29&selection=145,0,146,44|ðŸ”—]]

Lastly, let us consider travelling-wave solutions of Maxwellâ€™s equations in the absence of external stimuli. We can differentiate two cases, depending on the polarization direction of the electric field vector:

- **Transverse waves**, $\mathbf{K} \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$, resulting in the generic dispersion relation:
  $$
  K^2 = \varepsilon(\mathbf{K}, \omega) \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}.
  $$

- **Longitudinal waves**:
  $$
  \varepsilon(\mathbf{K}, \omega) = 0,
  $$

This signifies that longitudinal collective oscillations can only occur at frequencies corresponding to zeros of $\varepsilon(\omega)$.

### 1.1.4 The Dielectric Function of the Free Electron Gas
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=30&selection=12,0,12,47|ðŸ”—]]

Over a wide frequency range, the optical properties of metals can be explained by a plasma model, where a gas of free electrons of number density $n$ moves against a fixed background of positive ion cores. For alkali metals, this range extends up to the ultraviolet, while for noble metals, interband transitions occur at visible frequencies. In the plasma model, details of the lattice potential and electron-electron interactions are not considered. Instead, one assumes that some aspects of the band structure are incorporated into the effective optical mass $m$ of each electron. 

The electrons oscillate in response to the applied electromagnetic field, and their motion is damped via collisions occurring with a characteristic collision frequency $\gamma = \frac{1}{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is known as the relaxation time of the free electron gas, typically on the order of $10^{-14} \, \text{s}$ at room temperature, corresponding to $\gamma = 100 \, \text{THz}$.

The equation of motion for an electron in the plasma sea subject to an external electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is:

$$
m\ddot{x} + m\gamma\dot{x} = -e\mathbf{E}.
$$

Assuming a harmonic time dependence $\mathbf{E}(t) = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{-i\omega t}$ of the driving field, a particular solution describing the oscillation of the electron is $x(t) = x_0 e^{-i\omega t}$. The complex amplitude $x_0$ incorporates any phase shifts between the driving field and the response via:

$$
x(t) = \frac{e}{m(\omega^2 + i\gamma \omega)} \mathbf{E}(t).
$$

The displaced electrons contribute to the macroscopic polarization $\mathbf{P} = -nex$, explicitly given by:

$$
\mathbf{P} = -\frac{ne^2}{m(\omega^2 + i\gamma \omega)} \mathbf{E}.
$$

This leads to:

$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon(\omega) = 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 + i\gamma \omega}, && \text{where} && \omega_p^2 = \frac{ne^2}{\varepsilon_0 m},
\end{align}
$$

where $\omega_p$ is the plasma frequency of the free electron gas. The real and imaginary components of this complex dielectric function $\varepsilon(\omega) = \varepsilon_1(\omega) + i \varepsilon_2(\omega)$ are given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon_1(\omega) = 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2 \tau^2}{1 + \omega^2 \tau^2}, &&
\varepsilon_2(\omega) = \frac{\omega_p^2 \tau}{\omega (1 + \omega^2 \tau^2)},
\end{align}
$$

where $\gamma = \frac{1}{\tau}$.

**For large frequencies** close to $\omega_p$, the product $\omega \tau \gg 1$, leading to negligible damping. Here, $\varepsilon(\omega)$ is predominantly real, and:

$$
\varepsilon(\omega) = 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2},
$$

can be taken as the dielectric function of the undamped free electron plasma. Note that in this frequency region, noble metals exhibit significant interband transitions, causing an increase in $\varepsilon_2$.

**For very low frequencies**, where $\omega \ll \tau^{-1}$, we find $\varepsilon_2 \gg \varepsilon_1$, and the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index are comparable in magnitude:

$$
n \approx \kappa = \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\tau \omega_p^2}{2\omega}}.
$$

In this region, metals are primarily absorbing, with an absorption coefficient:

$$
\alpha = \left( \frac{2\omega_p^2 \tau \omega}{c^2} \right)^{1/2}.
$$

By introducing the DC conductivity $\sigma_0$, this expression can be recast as:

$$
\alpha = \sqrt{2 \sigma_0 \omega \mu_0}.
$$

Applying Beerâ€™s law of absorption implies that, at low frequencies, fields fall off inside the metal as $e^{-z/\delta}$, where $\delta$ is the skin depth:

$$
\delta = \frac{2}{\alpha} = \frac{c}{\kappa \omega} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\sigma_0 \omega \mu_0}}.
$$

This description holds as long as the mean free path of the electrons satisfies the condition $l \ll \delta$. At room temperature, for typical metals, $l \approx 10$ nm and $\delta \approx 100$ nm, justifying the free-electron model. At low temperatures, however, the mean free path increases significantly, altering the penetration depth. This phenomenon is known as the **anomalous skin effect**.

Using $\sigma$ instead of $\varepsilon$ for describing the dielectric response of metals reveals that in the absorbing regime, $\sigma$ is predominantly real, and the free charge velocity responds in phase with the driving field. At DC, relaxation effects of free charges are described by the real DC-conductivity $\sigma_0$, while the response of bound charges is included in a dielectric constant $\varepsilon_B$.

**At higher frequencies** ($1 \leq \omega\tau \leq \omega_p \tau$), the complex refractive index becomes predominantly imaginary, resulting in a reflection coefficient $R \approx 1$, and $\sigma$ acquires a more complex character, blurring the boundary between free and bound charges.

For noble metals such as silver, gold, and copper, an extension to the free-electron model is required in the region $\omega > \omega_p$. Here, the response is dominated by free $s$ electrons, while the filled $d$ band near the Fermi surface contributes to a highly polarized environment. This residual polarization due to the positive ion core background is described by adding the term $P_\infty = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_\infty - 1)\mathbf{E}$, where $\mathbf{P}$ represents only the polarization due to free electrons. This effect is characterized by a dielectric constant $\varepsilon_\infty$ (usually $1 \leq \varepsilon_\infty \leq 10$), and the dielectric function becomes:

$$
\varepsilon(\omega) = \varepsilon_\infty - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 + i\gamma \omega}.
$$

Comparing this description to the measured dielectric function of gold shows that the applicability of the free-electron model in the visible spectrum breaks down due to interband transitions:

![Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153506.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153506.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=33&rect=46,494,390,614|ðŸ”—]]

The dielectric function of the free electron plasma is closely related to the classical Drude model for the AC conductivity $\sigma(\omega)$ of metals:

$$
\sigma(\omega) = \frac{\sigma_0}{1 - i\omega\tau}.
$$

From this, we find:

$$
\varepsilon(\omega) = 1 + \frac{i\sigma(\omega)}{\varepsilon_0 \omega},
$$

recovering the general result. The dielectric function of the free electron gas is thus also referred to as the **Drude model** of the optical response of metals.


### 1.1.5 The Dispersion of the Free Electron Gas and Volume Plasmons
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=34&selection=41,0,42,8|ðŸ”—]]

Let us discuss the transparency regime $\omega>\omega_p$ of the free electron gas model. The dispersion of the[[Notes/Plasmonics#1.1.3 Travelling-Wave Solution\| travelling waves]] is:
$$
\omega^2=\omega_p^2+K^2c^2.
$$
This relation is plotted here:
![Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153506-1.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153506-1.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=34&rect=115,101,334,248|ðŸ”—]]

For frequencies below the plasma frequency, the propagation of transverse electromagnetic waves is forbidden inside the metal plasma. For larger frequencies however, the plasma supports transverse waves propagating with a group velocity $v_g=d\omega/dK<c$. Noting that $\epsilon(K=0, \omega_p)=0$, the excitation must correspond to a collective longitudinal mode. Then, at the plasma frequency, the electric field is a pure depolarisation field.
The physical significance if this excitation at the plasma frequency can be understood considering the collective longitudinal oscillation of the conduction electron gas versus the fixed positive background of the ion core in a plasma slab:
![Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153506-2.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153506-2.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=35&rect=103,535,333,620|ðŸ”—]]

A collective displacement of the electron cloud leads to a surface charge density at the slab boundaries. This establishes a homogeneous electric field inside the slab. Therefore, the displace electrons experience a restoring force, and the plasma frequency is the natural frequency of a free oscillation of the electron sea. This assumes all electrons move in phase, thus the plasma frequency corresponds to the oscillation frequency in the long-wavelength limit where $K=0$. 
The quanta of these charge oscillations are called volume plasmons, to distinguish them from surface and localized plasmons. Due to the longitudinal nature of the excitation, volume plasmons do not couple to transverse electromagnetic waves, and can only be excited by particle impact. Another consequence of this is that their decay occurs only via energy transfer to single electrons, a process known as Landau damping.
In addition to the in-phase oscillation at $\omega_p$ , there exists a whole class of longitudinal oscillations at higher frequencies with finite wavevectors, for which $\epsilon(K,\omega)=0$ is fulfilled:

$$\omega^2=\omega_{\mathrm{p}}^2+\frac{6 E_{\mathrm{F}} K^2}{5 m}.$$

### 1.1.6 Real Metals and Interband Transitions
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=36&selection=53,0,53,37|ðŸ”—]]

As already mentioned, the dielectric function of the Drude model adequately describes th eoptical response of metals only for photons below the transition energy between electronic bands. For some noble metals, interband effects already occur around 1 eV ($\lambda\approx 1\mu m$), for example for silver:
![Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153507.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153507.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - Fundamentals and Applications.pdf#page=36&rect=51,99,394,215|ðŸ”—]]
The red dots are experimentally obtained results, while the line is a fit of the Drude model. Clearly, the model is no adequate to describe neither real nor imaginary part of the dielectric function at high frequencies, and in the case of gold, its validity already breaks down close to the visible.

# 2 Surface Plasmon Polaritons on Metallic Surfaces
## 2.1 Wood's Anomalies
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=53&selection=1,0,1,26|ðŸ”—]]

Although the notion of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) appeared long afterwards, their generation was described at the very beginning of the 20th century. In 1902, Wood observed the spectra obtained using an optical grating of a continuous light source produced by an incandescent lamp (a filament is heated until it glows). He found that, under certain conditions, the drop maximum to minimum occurred within a range of wavelengths smaller than the distance between the sodium lines. Wood found narrow bright and dark lines in various spectra obtained from different conditions of incidence. However, these lines were only present for p-polarised light, so that the magnetic field is parallel to the grating grooves. The theory of gratings was in an early stage, thus the term 'anomaly'.
Rayleigh proposed tat an anomaly in a given spectrum occurs at the wavelength for which a scattered wave emerges tangentially to the grating surface. The grating formula,
$$\sin(\theta_n) = \sin(\theta) + \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$
with $\theta$ the angle of incidence, $\theta_n$ the angle of diffraction, and $d$ is the groove period turned out to be a great tool to predict the Wood's anomalies. This formula allows one to calculate the diffraction angle of any scattered order $n$ given the right parameters. 
The 'passing-off' (as Rayleigh termed it), occurs when $\sin(\theta_n)=\pm 1$, such that the wavelengths generating this passing-off are:
$$\frac{n\lambda}{d} = -\sin(\theta) \pm 1, \quad n = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \ldots$$
At normal incidence, uniform illumination was observed. With an incidence on the other side of the normal, two lines separated and they were very brilliant up to a certain wavelength, before the intensity suddenly dropped to zero.  
However, the Rayleigh prediction is unable to explain some vital experimental results, which come mainly from the fact that the grating equation is a purely geometric one. Fano distinguished two kinds of anomalies:
- A sharp/Rayleigh anomaly: An edge of intensity appears along the spectrum at sharply defined wavelengths governed by the grating formula using the Rayleigh conjecture. 
- A diffuse anomaly: It extends for a wavelength interval from the first one (the edge) to the red, and â€œconsists generally of a minimum and a maximum of intensity (one dark band and one bright band).
He explained that the Rayleigh conjecture predicts the location of the sharp anomaly, while Wood observed the diffuse anomaly. Further he explained the diffuse anomaly by 'a forced resonance', related to the 'leaky waves supportable by the grating'. 

The theory of Woodâ€™s anomalies described in this chapter is based on electromagnetics. In other words, it starts from the macroscopic properties of metals through electromagnetic parameters like permittivity and permeability and never takes into account their microscopic structure
## 2.2 Propagation of Surface Plasmon Polaritons on a Metallic Surface
### 2.2.1 Flat Surface
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=60&selection=10,0,10,30|ðŸ”—]]

In a scattering problem, an object is illuminated by an incident electromagnetic wave, and one is interested in the total field at any point in space. This total field consists of the known incident field and the scattered field generated by the object. This chapter treats the scattering on a metallic half-plane:
![Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153507-1.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Notes/Plasmonics/IMG-0122153507-1.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=61&rect=165,478,388,612|ðŸ”—]]
An incident plane wave propagating in a lossless dielectric material of optical index $\nu_1=\sqrt{\varepsilon_1}$, where $\varepsilon_1$  is the relative permittivity, illuminates a non-magnetic metallic half-plane of complex index $\nu_2=\sqrt{\varepsilon_2}$. An incident field $\mathbf{F}^{\mathbf{i}}$ with unit amplitude can be written in the form:

$$\begin{align*}
\mathbf{F}^{\mathbf{i}}=F^i \hat{\mathbf{z}}=\exp \left(i k_1(\alpha x-\beta y)\right) \hat{\mathbf{z}}
\end{align*}$$
with $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ being the unit vector of the $z$-axis (orthogonal to the $x y$ plane), $k_1=k \nu_1=\frac{2 \pi \nu_1}{\lambda}$ being the wavenumber in the dielectric material and 
$$\begin{align*}
\begin{gathered}
F^i=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\text { incident electric field } E^i \text { for s-polarized light, } \\
\text { incident magnetic field } H^i \text { for p-polarized light, }
\end{array}\right. \\
\alpha=\sin (\theta), \quad \beta=\cos (\theta)
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}$$

with $\theta$ being the angle of incidence, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ being called normalized propagation constants of the wave in the following. It can be shown that the projections on the $z$-axis of the reflected and transmitted fields $F^r$ and $F^t$ can be written as:

$$F_r = r \exp \left( i k_1 \left( \alpha x + i \beta y \right) \right)$$
$$F_t = t \exp \left( i k_1 \left( \alpha x - i \gamma y \right) \right)$$
$$\gamma = \sqrt{\nu^2 - \alpha^2}, \quad \nu = \frac{\nu_2}{\nu_1}$$
{ #eq-reflected-transmitted-field}


If the metal is replaced by a lossless dielectric material, the choice of determination of $\gamma$ is clear: The transmitted wave must propagate downwards to satisfy a radiation condition, thus the real value of  must be positive.  
The assumption that $\nu$ is purely imaginary, i.e., $\nu = i \nu''$ is close to the actual values of indices of metals in the visible region, and leads to 
$$
\gamma = \sqrt{-\nu''^2 - \alpha^2} = \pm i \sqrt{\nu''^2 + \alpha^2}.
$$
Since the field must decrease in modulus as $y \to -\infty$, the imaginary part must be positive. Thus, to adopt a determination of $\gamma$ which applies to any material, the authorized region of the complex plane of $\gamma$ must include both half-lines defined by $\text{Im} (\gamma) = 0, \text{Re} (\gamma) > 0$ and $\text{Re} (\gamma) = 0, \text{Im} (\gamma) > 0$.  
In reality, the index of metals is neither real nor purely imaginary, but its real and imaginary parts are always positive. Thus, a natural way to adopt a general determination for $\gamma$ is to choose in the complex plane a half-plane containing both the positive real axis (choice of $\nu$ for a lossless dielectric material) and the positive imaginary axis (choice of $\nu$ for a purely imaginary index).  
In the following, we will determine $\gamma$ from:  
$$
\text{Re} \{\gamma\} + \text{Im} \{\gamma\} > 0.$$
Eventually, this leads to the Fresnel coefficients for p-polarised light,
$$ r = \frac{\beta / \varepsilon_1 - \gamma / \varepsilon_2}{\beta / \varepsilon_1 + \gamma / \varepsilon_2}, \quad t = \frac{2 \beta / \varepsilon_1}{\beta / \varepsilon_1 + \gamma / \varepsilon_2}, $$
which allows to solve the problem of scattering on a flat interface.
### 2.2.2 Guiding by a Flat Surface: The Surface Plasmon Polariton
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=62&selection=180,0,180,45|ðŸ”—]]

We want to know whether a surface wave can propagate at the surface of the metal. Classically, a guided wave is a wave propagating along the x-axis and satisfies a radiation condition at infinity:
 - For $y â†’ +\infty$, the field must propagate upwards or vanish,  
 - For $y â†’ âˆ’\infty$, the field must propagate downwards or vanish.

In addition to these conditions, the total field in the guided wave must satisfy the Maxwell equations and boundary conditions at the interface. The field above the interface contains the incident wave, which does not satisfy the radiation condition since it propagates towards the interface. In other words, a guided wave corresponds to a problem of scattering in which the incident field does not exist. At first glance, such a guided wave should not exist. Indeed, in the scattering problem, the incident energy is shared between the scattered field and the losses inside the metal. On the other hand, in the problem of guiding, there is no incident energy at all, and of course the existence of a field generates losses in the metal. Thus it seems that such a wave cannot satisfy the energy balance. This remark is quite correct as far as the propagation constant of the guided wave is real. 
Considering the expressions of the reflected and transmitted [[Notes/Plasmonics#^eq-reflected-transmitted-field\|waves]], the propagation constant $k_1\alpha$ is real since it is imposed by the incident plane wave. This requirement does not hold in guiding, and it can be conjectured that a surface wave may propagate along the x-axis with an exponentially decreasing amplitude, due to the losses in the metal. The consequence: The imaginary part of the propagation constant must be positive, if its real part is positive. 
Therefore, the search for a surface wave leads to the search for a solution of the field in a scattering problem, but without an incident wave (or the 'homogeneous solution to the Maxwell equations).
This leads to several solutions:

- If $\nu = +1$, it means the metal has been replaced by the same dielectric material as above the interface.
- If $\nu=-1$, the solution is unrealistic for non-magnetic materials.

The conclusion is that, for s-polarised light, the propagation on a flat metal surface of a guided wave is impossible. Regarding p-polarised light, the solution is 
$$\alpha=\tilde{\alpha}^\text{plane}=\pm \nu/\sqrt{1+\nu^2},$$
where the tilde indicates a surface wave, and the plane superscript indicates that the interface is a plane. The two opposite values for $\alpha$ represent the constants of propagation of two waves propagating in opposite directions. This kind of wave is called surface plasmon (polariton). In normalised form, the magnetic field $H$ is given as

$$
H = 
\begin{cases} 
\exp \left( i k_1 \left( \tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}} x + \tilde{\beta}_{\text{plane}} y \right) \right), & \text{in the dielectric}, \\
\exp \left( i k_1 \left( \tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}} x - \tilde{\gamma}_{\text{plane}} y \right) \right), & \text{in the metal}.
\end{cases}
$$
The real part of $\tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}}$ is slightly greater than unity, while its imaginary part is very small. This is a general result for metals in the visible and infrared regions, explaining why SPPs cannot be excited by a plane wave.

The propagation constant on the $x$-axis of a plane wave is equal to $k_1 \sin(\theta)$ (circle), which is always smaller than $k_1$ in modulus. In contrast, the real part of $k_1 \tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}}$ is larger. Since the surface is flat, a plane wave cannot excite a field with a significantly different propagation constant and, hence, cannot excite the SPP.
