# 1 Surface Plasmon Polaritons on Metallic Surfaces
## 1.1 Wood's Anomalies
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=53&selection=1,0,1,26|ðŸ”—]]

Although the notion of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) appeared long afterwards, their generation was described at the very beginning of the 20th century. In 1902, Wood observed the spectra obtained using an optical grating of a continuous light source produced by an incandescent lamp (a filament is heated until it glows). He found that, under certain conditions, the drop maximum to minimum occurred within a range of wavelengths smaller than the distance between the sodium lines. Wood found narrow bright and dark lines in various spectra obtained from different conditions of incidence. However, these lines were only present for p-polarised light, so that the magnetic field is parallel to the grating grooves. The theory of gratings was in an early stage, thus the term 'anomaly'.
Rayleigh proposed tat an anomaly in a given spectrum occurs at the wavelength for which a scattered wave emerges tangentially to the grating surface. The grating formula,
$$\sin(\theta_n) = \sin(\theta) + \frac{n\lambda}{d}$$
with $\theta$ the angle of incidence, $\theta_n$ the angle of diffraction, and $d$ is the groove period turned out to be a great tool to predict the Wood's anomalies. This formula allows one to calculate the diffraction angle of any scattered order $n$ given the right parameters. 
The 'passing-off' (as Rayleigh termed it), occurs when $\sin(\theta_n)=\pm 1$, such that the wavelengths generating this passing-off are:
$$\frac{n\lambda}{d} = -\sin(\theta) \pm 1, \quad n = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \ldots$$
At normal incidence, uniform illumination was observed. With an incidence on the other side of the normal, two lines separated and they were very brilliant up to a certain wavelength, before the intensity suddenly dropped to zero.  
However, the Rayleigh prediction is unable to explain some vital experimental results, which come mainly from the fact that the grating equation is a purely geometric one. Fano distinguished two kinds of anomalies:
- A sharp/Rayleigh anomaly: An edge of intensity appears along the spectrum at sharply defined wavelengths governed by the grating formula using the Rayleigh conjecture. 
- A diffuse anomaly: It extends for a wavelength interval from the first one (the edge) to the red, and â€œconsists generally of a minimum and a maximum of intensity (one dark band and one bright band).
He explained that the Rayleigh conjecture predicts the location of the sharp anomaly, while Wood observed the diffuse anomaly. Further he explained the diffuse anomaly by 'a forced resonance', related to the 'leaky waves supportable by the grating'. 

The theory of Woodâ€™s anomalies described in this chapter is based on electromagnetics. In other words, it starts from the macroscopic properties of metals through electromagnetic parameters like permittivity and permeability and never takes into account their microscopic structure

In a scattering problem, an object is illuminated by an incident electromagnetic wave, and one is interested in the total field at any point in space. This total field consists of the known incident field and the scattered field generated by the object. This chapter treats the scattering on a metallic half-plane:
![Attachments/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Plasmonics%20-%20From%20Basics%20to%20Advanced%20Topics.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=61&rect=165,478,388,612|ðŸ”—]]
An incident plane wave propagating in a lossless dielectric material of optical index $\nu_1=\sqrt{\varepsilon_1}$, where $\varepsilon_1$  is the relative permittivity, illuminates a non-magnetic metallic half-plane of complex index $\nu_2=\sqrt{\varepsilon_2}$. An incident field $\mathbf{F}^{\mathbf{i}}$ with unit amplitude can be written in the form:

$$\begin{align*}
\mathbf{F}^{\mathbf{i}}=F^i \hat{\mathbf{z}}=\exp \left(i k_1(\alpha x-\beta y)\right) \hat{\mathbf{z}}
\end{align*}$$
with $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ being the unit vector of the $z$-axis (orthogonal to the $x y$ plane), $k_1=k \nu_1=\frac{2 \pi \nu_1}{\lambda}$ being the wavenumber in the dielectric material and 
$$\begin{align*}
\begin{gathered}
F^i=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\text { incident electric field } E^i \text { for s-polarized light, } \\
\text { incident magnetic field } H^i \text { for p-polarized light, }
\end{array}\right. \\
\alpha=\sin (\theta), \quad \beta=\cos (\theta)
\end{gathered}
\end{align*}$$

with $\theta$ being the angle of incidence, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ being called normalized propagation constants of the wave in the following. It can be shown that the projections on the $z$-axis of the reflected and transmitted fields $F^r$ and $F^t$ can be written as:

$$F_r = r \exp \left( i k_1 \left( \alpha x + i \beta y \right) \right)$$
$$F_t = t \exp \left( i k_1 \left( \alpha x - i \gamma y \right) \right)$$
$$\gamma = \sqrt{\nu^2 - \alpha^2}, \quad \nu = \frac{\nu_2}{\nu_1}$$
{ #eq-reflected-transmitted-field}


If the metal is replaced by a lossless dielectric material, the choice of determination of $\gamma$ is clear: The transmitted wave must propagate downwards to satisfy a radiation condition, thus the real value of  must be positive.  
The assumption that $\nu$ is purely imaginary, i.e., $\nu = i \nu''$ is close to the actual values of indices of metals in the visible region, and leads to 
$$
\gamma = \sqrt{-\nu''^2 - \alpha^2} = \pm i \sqrt{\nu''^2 + \alpha^2}.
$$
Since the field must decrease in modulus as $y \to -\infty$, the imaginary part must be positive. Thus, to adopt a determination of $\gamma$ which applies to any material, the authorized region of the complex plane of $\gamma$ must include both half-lines defined by $\text{Im} (\gamma) = 0, \text{Re} (\gamma) > 0$ and $\text{Re} (\gamma) = 0, \text{Im} (\gamma) > 0$.  
In reality, the index of metals is neither real nor purely imaginary, but its real and imaginary parts are always positive. Thus, a natural way to adopt a general determination for $\gamma$ is to choose in the complex plane a half-plane containing both the positive real axis (choice of $\nu$ for a lossless dielectric material) and the positive imaginary axis (choice of $\nu$ for a purely imaginary index).  
In the following, we will determine $\gamma$ from:  
$$
\text{Re} \{\gamma\} + \text{Im} \{\gamma\} > 0.$$
Eventually, this leads to the Fresnel coefficients for p-polarised light,
$$ r = \frac{\beta / \varepsilon_1 - \gamma / \varepsilon_2}{\beta / \varepsilon_1 + \gamma / \varepsilon_2}, \quad t = \frac{2 \beta / \varepsilon_1}{\beta / \varepsilon_1 + \gamma / \varepsilon_2}, $$
which allows to solve the problem of scattering on a flat interface.
### 1.2.2 Guiding by a Flat Surface: The Surface Plasmon Polariton
[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=62&selection=180,0,180,45|ðŸ”—]]

We want to know whether a surface wave can propagate at the surface of the metal. Classically, a guided wave is a wave propagating along the x-axis and satisfies a radiation condition at infinity:
 - For $y â†’ +\infty$, the field must propagate upwards or vanish,  
 - For $y â†’ âˆ’\infty$, the field must propagate downwards or vanish.

In addition to these conditions, the total field in the guided wave must satisfy the Maxwell equations and boundary conditions at the interface. The field above the interface contains the incident wave, which does not satisfy the radiation condition since it propagates towards the interface. In other words, a guided wave corresponds to a problem of scattering in which the incident field does not exist. At first glance, such a guided wave should not exist. Indeed, in the scattering problem, the incident energy is shared between the scattered field and the losses inside the metal. On the other hand, in the problem of guiding, there is no incident energy at all, and of course the existence of a field generates losses in the metal. Thus it seems that such a wave cannot satisfy the energy balance. This remark is quite correct as far as the propagation constant of the guided wave is real. 
Considering the expressions of the reflected and transmitted [[Notes/Plasmonics#^eq-reflected-transmitted-field\|waves]], the propagation constant $k_1\alpha$ is real since it is imposed by the incident plane wave. This requirement does not hold in guiding, and it can be conjectured that a surface wave may propagate along the x-axis with an exponentially decreasing amplitude, due to the losses in the metal. The consequence: The imaginary part of the propagation constant must be positive, if its real part is positive. 
Therefore, the search for a surface wave leads to the search for a solution of the field in a scattering problem, but without an incident wave (or the 'homogeneous solution to the Maxwell equations).
This leads to several solutions:

- If $\nu = +1$, it means the metal has been replaced by the same dielectric material as above the interface.
- If $\nu=-1$, the solution is unrealistic for non-magnetic materials.

The conclusion is that, for s-polarised light, the propagation on a flat metal surface of a guided wave is impossible. Regarding p-polarised light, the solution is 
$$\alpha=\tilde{\alpha}^\text{plane}=\pm \nu/\sqrt{1+\nu^2},$$
where the tilde indicates a surface wave, and the plane superscript indicates that the interface is a plane. The two opposite values for $\alpha$ represent the constants of propagation of two waves propagating in opposite directions. This kind of wave is called surface plasmon (polariton). In normalised form, the magnetic field $H$ is given as

$$
H = 
\begin{cases} 
\exp \left( i k_1 \left( \tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}} x + \tilde{\beta}_{\text{plane}} y \right) \right), & \text{in the dielectric}, \\
\exp \left( i k_1 \left( \tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}} x - \tilde{\gamma}_{\text{plane}} y \right) \right), & \text{in the metal}.
\end{cases}
$$
The real part of $\tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}}$ is slightly greater than unity, while its imaginary part is very small. This is a general result for metals in the visible and infrared regions, explaining why SPPs cannot be excited by a plane wave.  
![Attachments/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics 1.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Plasmonics%20-%20From%20Basics%20to%20Advanced%20Topics%201.webp)![Attachments/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics 2.webp|700](/img/user/Attachments/Plasmonics%20-%20From%20Basics%20to%20Advanced%20Topics%202.webp)[[Reading/Books/Plasmonics/Plasmonics - From Basics to Advanced Topics.pdf#page=65&rect=50,454,392,493|ðŸ”—]]

The propagation constant on the $x$-axis of a plane wave is equal to $k_1 \sin(\theta)$ (circle), which is always smaller than $k_1$ in modulus. In contrast, the real part of $k_1 \tilde{\alpha}_{\text{plane}}$ is larger. Since the surface is flat, a plane wave cannot excite a field with a significantly different propagation constant and, hence, cannot excite the SPP.
