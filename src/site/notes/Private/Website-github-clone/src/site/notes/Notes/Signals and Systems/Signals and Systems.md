These notes will mostly follow along the book [Signals and Systems - 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-2nd-Alan-Oppenheim/dp/0138147574) by A. Oppenheim and A. Willsky, and [Discrete-Time Signal Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-3rd-Prentice-Hall/dp/0131988425) by A. Oppenheim and R. Schafter.

The concepts of signals and systems arise in a wide variety of fields. Although their physical nature is widely different for their respective application in different fields, they have two basic things in common: 
1. The signals, which are functions of independent variables, contain information about the behaviour or nature of some phenomenon.
2. The systems respond to particular signals by producing other signals or some desired behaviour. 

There are countless examples of signals, for example Voltage and currents as functions of time in an electrical circuit. The history of this field extends back over many centuries, and although most of this work was motivated by specific applications, many of these ideas have proven to be of central importance to problem is a far larger variety of contexts than those for which they were originally intended.
